# Boot-Camp-Magist-Project-1

First project in WBS Data Science Boot Camp:

We explored a database from a company called Magist based in Brazil in order to decide whether or not to recommend Magist to a different company called Eniac looking to expand into Brazil.

The SQL queries were used to explore the data and find our answers and supporting points, and then we used Tableau to create some visual aids.

Result: We do not recommend Magist for the expansion project.
